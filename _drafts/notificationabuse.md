# Notification Abuse

Notification icons are an insanely powerful way to direct a user's focus. While their visual weight plays a role in this, the true influence of these icons is their prior association with reward. Companies looking to drive engagement have started recognizing this power, and have been consequently putting anything and everything that needs attention in notification dropdowns. In addition to being frustrating for users, this exploitation of conditioned behavior has long-term impacts that discourages users from returning to these dropdowns in the future.

In early email clients like Outlook Express, the common practice was to associate bold text with unread emails. Thus, unread folders titles were also bolded, with the number of unread emails written next to the folder name in parentheses (this remains standard practice for email today). Thus, when Facebook introduced an inbox for their private messaging feature in 2010, they adopted this design pattern. Users who were familiar with email could jump straight in.

Despite the alerts not holding tremendous visual weight, the mapping was 1:1. Every time that "Inbox" was bolded, you had a new message. Users knew exactly what they were getting every single time they clicked "Inbox" â€” they were always rewarded with new emails. Operant conditioning at its finest.[^1]

## Notification Menus

Over time products started bulking up on features. Notification dropdowns started to gain traction, consoldating many types of notifications from many different product features into a single view. The simultaneous growth of smartphones and mobile apps brought about tab bars, providing a convenience place to port these notificiation dropdowns to mobile UI.

For these feature-dense products, grouping notifications together under a single alert makes sense. If the user wants updates from a range of features, this design decision makes things easy and intutive. One click on the notification alert and you're caught up with everything.

However, by abstracting notifications away from their associated feature, notifications no longer need to be feature-specific.

This is extinction (psychology). I couldn't find any research on this, but I would assume it to hold true. Giving an undesired response (no notification / bad notification) to clicking a notification alert icon will make you less likely to do the same in the future. It's a degradation of trust.

The most frustrating example of this that I recently came across is ProductHunt's navigation bar on web. There is a orange alert icon next to the "Jobs" menu item, which you cannot dismiss. It's so incredibly bizarre and frustrating that it could almost be a bug. Looking purely at conversions, you would think that button is designed _damn_ well. Everyone clicks it! Talking to users would tell a different story.
