# Urbanizing the Internet

- 1990s internet: optimistic about people sharing spaces; communicating across boundaries; bringing tolerance and apprecation for other perspectives
- 2017 internet: people look to affirm their own beliefs. internet is divisive instead of uniting.

The internet is like a suburb. Other places exist, but you stick with what makes you most comfortable â€” people that share your interests and experience. Cities challenge beliefs because they force this contact with differing opinions; how do we bring this forced contact to the internet?
