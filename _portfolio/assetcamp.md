# AssetCamp

[AssetCamp](http://assetcamp.io) is a community for 3D creators to showcase and sell their 3D models. I worked closely with the founders to shape the AssetCamp brand identity and build the AssetCamp website.

## Research

Before building anything, the founders reached out to many 3D creatives, game developers, and VR developers on various online communities. Not only did these conversations help to validate the product, but they were also invaluable in understanding what people wanted and how people would use AssetCamp. One key insight that emerged from these conversations suggested that there is little overlap between AssetCamp's two user groups — people were interested in either buying assets or selling assets, but were rarely interested in both.

This insight led to the website being split into two entirely distinct account types and interfaces. Subscriber accounts could not upload 3D assets for sale, and creator accounts purchase 3D assets. Gathering this feedback and making this decision early-on was crucial, as it had massive implications on how the product would be designed and built.

## Background

Because the founders chose to progressively roll out functionality to test the market, the product needed to shift and evolve as new users were targeted and new features were added. AssetCamp requires two established groups of users to succeed: subscribers, who have paid for a subscription to download 3D assets for use in their projects, and creators, who publish their 3D assets for sale.

In order to mitigate the chicken and egg problem, the initial release of AssetCamp only targeted creators, first allowing them to join a waiting list, and later allowing them to access their portfolio and upload their 3D assets for sale. Only once a catalog of assets had been amassed by creators could subscribers create accounts and start purchasing.

## Creators

When I joined the team, my first project was to quickly build a landing page that provided basic information AssetCamp and allowed creators to join a waiting list. There are a few pieces of information that were necessary to convey. Most importantly, given the multitude of competitors on the market, it was crucial to differentiate AssetCamp. Additionally, making the sign up form within reach at any view worked to convert as many interested creators as possible.

Once the landing had gained some traction among 3D creators and sufficient back-end development had been completed, I moved on to wireframing the entire onboarding process for creators.

Given that most creators would already have a portfolio of assets ready to be posted on AssetCamp, it was important to encourage uploads as soon as creators finished account creation. Hence, a friendly modal encouraging uploads pops up on the first visit to the portfolio page. This modal also clues creators into the fact that future file uploads can be accomplished via drag-and-drop.

After files have been selected to be uploaded, it was important to collect information on the model to make 3D model searching more dynamic and informative. Forcing creators to specify both categories and tags helps to build a subscriber user experience that is compelling in a wide variety of use cases and search behaviors. If a subscriber is interested in finding an asset through menus and clicks, categories are exclusive enough to provide meaningful results. And for subscribers searching for assets via search bar, keywords help in providing precise results to match detailed queries.

## Logo and Branding

AssetCamp had a lot of elements that could be latched onto for branding. The sentence "a subscription marketplace and community for 3D assets" is rich in imagery, and leaves a lot for a brand to latch onto. The metaphor of the community as a campground only furthers the number of directions that can be taken. After sketching out a variety of logos both with and without the camping visuals, I decided to pursue a mark that combined visual depth with the camping motif. I jumped into Sketch and worked through a variety of iterations until I landed on something that the team and I were happy with.

I also worked to incorporate the three-dimensionality of the logo into other aspects of the website. I created a set of shaded icons to help illustrate AssetCamp's features on both landing pages, and created a set of shaded shapes to pull the sense of playfulness and depth throughout the user experience.
