# Simple Questions Search

[Simple Questions Search](http://sqs.corbinmuraro.com) started as a little personal project inspired by Kevin Rose's mantra of [building for niche audiences](https://medium.com/@producthunt/kevin-rose-on-creating-stronger-startups-solving-world-problems-and-what-he-learned-at-digg-e5fffacd4314). In additon to providing value to a niche audience, the project helped me learn and improve on a variety of skills, from designing intuitive search interfaces to search indexing with [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) to web hosting on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

## Background

I have been an active reader of reddit's subreddit [/r/malefashionadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/) (MFA) for several years. As the name suggests, the community centered around getting feedback on anything related to male fashion. Every day, a new thread called Simple Questions is pinned to the top of the subreddit in which people can ask questions and answer questions. Each of these daily threads gets tens to hundreds of posts. Yet because reddit search is restricted to thread *titles*, years and years of Simple Questions full of thoughtful, quality advice end up lost to reddit's servers.

By reviving tens of thousands of bits of fashion advice, my goal was to make an advanced search for people that couldn't find an answer to their specific male fashion question elsewhere on the internet. 


## Building an MVP

To determine if the website would even provide meaningful value beyond what's available on reddit's default search, I decided to build an MVP and see what sort of results Simple Questions threads would spit out. The project was intimiating from a coding perspective, as I had no previous experience building a search engine or even working with servers. Eventually, I got a prototype running with Solr used to index reddit post data and a super simple front-end built out of [Solrstrap](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/solrstrap).

I explained what I built to some friends who regularly use MFA, and gave them the link to see if situations would ever come up for them in which the website would provide value. I also posted on a General Discssion thread on MFA for some casual first thoughts from people I didn't know. 

The feedback wasn't great. The results were confusing in that links didn't go where they were expected to go, and Solrstrap's autosearch / autoscroll functionality added nothing but clutter. Additionally, without my explanation or being told what the website is, a user would have no understanding of where the information is coming from or even what the purpose of the website is. It filled a need for people thinking about fashion, but a confusing and far too simple UI did users a disservice.


## A Total Redesign

With user feedback in hand, I discarded Solrstrap and rebuilt the front-end from scratch. Given that the website requires a bit of context given its niche purpose, I decided upon splitting the website into a landing page and a results page. This alotted me space to give new users the option to get their feet wet; instead of having to figure it out on their own, the landing page provides some understanding of where the content is coming from and what help the website hopes to provide.

### One Step Back and Two Steps Forward

One big issue with my MVP is that link text provided no value. Additionally, it wasn't very clear where the link was directing to. I iterated through several solutions for link text and placement, trying to ensure that the outlink text provided some understanding of where the link was going, while also sitting higher than inline post links in the page's visual hierarchy.

![results experiment 3](images/sqs-images/results-experiment-3.png){:class="centered-image small magnify"}.

After talking through this issue with a friend, I realized that I was stubborn in not considering removing inline links altogether. Few users would want to jump straight from Simple Questions Search to a comment link, and this cleaned up the visual style of the website while also being more obvious about what goes where.


## Thinking Broadly About Reddit Search

Though I am definitely no expert on databases, I imagine reddit's reason for not implementing comment search across the website is due the sheer amount of comments that would need to be indexed.

This project is testament to the notion that not all content on reddit is equally needing of comment search.

* On /r/malefashionadvice and similar subreddits, only threads with unhelpful titles (i.e. Simple Questions) need to be searched. Other threads will have a title that is descriptive enough for users to find the desired content via reddit's inbuilt search. 

* On many big subreddits like /r/askreddit or /r/funny, people are likely searching for a memorable comment that they came across earlier. These sorts of comments can be made searchable by only indexing the most upvoted comments on a given subreddit, or perhaps all gilded comments, or some combination of the the two variables.
