# [Screenkraut](https://devpost.com/software/big-decision)

I attended [PennApps XV](http://2017w.pennapps.com) last January and worked with 3 total strangers from around the world on an ultra-lightweight presentation webapp called Screenkraut. I was responsible for design and contributed to front-end development of the platform.

## Background

Realizing that [Prezi](http://prezi.com) is still a Flash application ([I'm not kidding](https://prezi.com/support/article/troubleshooting/system-requirements-for-prezi/#highendusage)), our team decided to build a similar presentation editor and viewer around the fantastic Javascript framework [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js/), with flashy 3D transitions, themes, etc. 

However, after thinking deeper about where we can add value given the many presentation tools already available on the market, we decided to turn the project into a lightweight and synchronized presentation builder and presenter for on-the-fly presentations.

## Approach

The product design centered around this idea of on-the-fly presentation building, in which it takes as few clicks as possible to create and as little effort as possible to share. With this said, the goal was also to minimize the reduction of use cases as much as possible.
