# [Visualizing Mars in Three.JS](http://corbinmuraro.com/mars-terrain)

[Mars Maps](http://corbinmuraro.com/mars-terrain) is a concept website that I built as an example of how to better take advantage of NASA's terrain imagery captured through [HiRISE](http://www.uahirise.org), one of the instruments on board NASA's [Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter). 

What follows is a brief introduction to three.js terrain modeling, utilizing Bj√∏rn Sandvik's wonderful TerrainLoader, available in the context of his blog post [here](http://blog.mastermaps.com/2013/10/terrain-building-with-threejs.html).
