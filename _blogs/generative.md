# Making Art With Code

Three years ago, I learned about someone named [Casey Reas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.E.B._Reas) who taught a course at UCLA in a programming language called Processing. It sounded super cool; a programming language that uses code to make art. Creative coding.

### Getting Serious

Over this last summer, I returned to the creative coding after coming across some Processing sketches on Twitter. Excited to give it a go, I started spending some time every night implementing new algorithms or tweaking existing ones.

What really got me excited was a type of creative coding called generative art. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art), generative art is art that is created with some degree of autonomy. While this could mean autonomy in that nature is taking control of portions of the artistic process, it usually refers to computer-generated pseudo-randomness. For instance, instead of telling the computer where lines and dots will be placed, you define constraints and allow the computer to decide on outcomes within the defined constraints.

Generative art is fun and unexpected. I could run the same program 100 times and get something totally distinct on each iteration. My hard drive started to fill up with screen grabs of my favorite results.

I focused on finding organic patterns in code, be it through textures or patterns. Utilizing the [Sand Spline technique](http://inconvergent.net/generative/sand-spline/) helped bring new depth to existing sketches.

Generative art is so many layers deep; I'm still barely scratching the surface. I'm excited to see how my sketches evolve over the coming months.

### Bridging the Gap Between Designers and Developers

To work well together and empathize with each other, I strongly believe that designers should have some understanding of code, and developers should have some understanding of design. Creative coding sits perfectly between the two disciplines, encouraging designers to become better developers and developers to become better designers.

I think that many designers and developers would love to play around with generative art, and the only thing preventing this from happening is that they haven't been exposed to it. Perhaps you were one of those people a few minutes ago. Read on for some suggestions on how to get started.

### Getting Started

If this sounds like something you'd like to try out, [Daniel Shiffman's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) is the place to get started. Daniel is the [Mister Rogers](https://twitter.com/johnmaeda/status/881146154054029313) of creative coding. His tutorials are enjoyable and easy to follow, while also being incredibly informative. If you're brand new to programming, I encourage you to start watching from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4).[^1]

As a next step, I highly recommend reading through Anders Hoff's [posts on generative algorithms](http://inconvergent.net/generative/). Anders introduces lots of great algorithms to add to your generative art tool belt. Several of my favorite sketches art inspired by his work.

Thanks for reading! If you'd like to view some of my favorite Processing sketches, [I made a little website for them](http://art.corbinmuraro.com). I'll keep adding to it as I make more.

[^1]: If anyone that tells me they want to learn to code, I point them to Daniel. I have never been a big believer in websites like Codecademy that teach you coding fundamentals in a sheltered environment, making it hard to take the training wheels off and turn the coursework into something real. When creating art with code, you are hacking things together and getting tangible results on day one. These near-immediate results are rewarding and encourage a novice programmer to keep going.
