# Making Art With Code

![generative sketch]({{site.baseurl}}/images/blog-images/generative-images/1.png)

Three years ago, I learned about someone named [Casey Reas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.E.B._Reas) who taught a course at UCLA in a programming language called Processing. It sounded super cool; a programming language that uses code to build art. Creative coding. The idea of using code to meld creativity and logic together got me really excited. Unfortunately, I didn't made it into the class and my lack of programming experience deterred me from trying to learn on my own.

### Getting Serious

A few months back, I returned to the creative coding after coming across some Processing sketches on Twitter. Now feeling comfortable with programming, I started spending an hour a night implementing new algorithms or tweaking existing ones.

What really got me excited was generative art. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art), generative art is art that is created with some degree of autonomy. While this could mean autonomy in that nature is taking control of portions of the artistic process, it usually refers to computer-generated pseudo-randomness. Instead of telling the computer where lines and dots will be placed, you define constraints and allow the computer to decide outcomes within the defined constraints.

I could run the same program 100 times and get something totally distinct on each iteration. My hard drive started to fill up with saved sketches.

I focused on finding organic patterns in code, be it through textures or patterns. Utilizing the [Sand Spline technique](http://inconvergent.net/generative/sand-spline/) helped bring new depth to existing sketches.

Generative art is so many layers deep; I'm still barely scratching the surface. I'm excited to see how my sketches evolve over the next few months.

### Bridging the Gap Between Designers and Developers

Designers should have some understanding of code, and developers should have some understanding of design. Creative coding sits perfectly between the two disciplines, encouraging designers to become better developers and developers to become better designers.

I am confident that many designers and developers would love to play around with generative art, and the only thing preventing them is that they haven't been exposed to it. Perhaps you were one of those people a few minutes ago. Read on for some suggestions on how to get started.

### Getting Started

If this sounds like something you'd like to try out, [Daniel Shiffman's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) is the place to get started[^1]. Daniel is the [Mister Rogers](https://twitter.com/johnmaeda/status/881146154054029313) of creative coding. His tutorials are enjoyable and easy to follow, while also being incredibly informative. If you're brand new to programming, I encourage you to start watching from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4).

As a next step, I highly recommend reading through Anders Hoff's [posts on generative algorithms](http://inconvergent.net/generative/). Anders introduces lots of great algorithms to add to your generative art tool belt. Several of my favorite sketches have been inspired by his work.

Thanks for reading! If you'd like to view some of my favorite Processing sketches, [I made a little website for them](http://art.corbinmuraro.com). I'll keep adding to it as I make more art.

[^1]: If anyone that tells me they want to learn to code, I point them to Daniel. I have never been a big believer in websites like Codecademy that teach you coding fundamentals in a sheltered environment, making it hard to take the training wheels off and turn the coursework into something real. When creating art with code, you are hacking things together and getting tangible results on day one. [It doesn't take much to make something cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo).
